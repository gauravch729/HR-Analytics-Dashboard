HR Analytics Report on Attrition and Employee Demographics

1. Overview
The HR dashboard provides insights into employee attrition across various dimensions such as department, gender, education, age, years at the company, and salary hikes. It presents data that helps understand the causes of employee turnover and the demographics most affected by attrition.


2. Key Metrics
Total Employees: 1,470 employees are currently part of the organization.
Attrition Count: 237 employees have left the organization, which is a significant number to investigate further.
Active Employees: 1,233 employees are still active, which is critical for retention strategies.
Average Age: 36.92 years is the average age, showing a mid-career workforce.


3. Attrition Analysis by Department
Departmental Breakdown:
HR: 12 employees (5.06%)

R&D: 92 employees (38.82%)

Sales: 133 employees (56.12%)

Key Insight: Sales has the highest attrition, indicating potential issues in job satisfaction, workload, or incentives in this department.


4. Attrition by Gender
Male: 87 (36.71%) of the total attrition.

Female: 150 (63.29%) have left, showing a significant difference in attrition rates.

Key Insight: Female employees are leaving at a much higher rate, which could point towards gender-related issues such as work-life balance, career progression, or workplace environment.


5. Education and Attrition
Bachelor’s Degree Holders: Highest attrition (over 100 employees), which may indicate that employees with less specialized skills face more challenges in job satisfaction or career growth.
Master’s Degree, Associate Degree, and Doctoral Degree holders: Lower attrition rates, potentially showing a higher level of job satisfaction or career commitment for those with advanced education.

Key Insight: Employees with lower education levels seem more likely to leave, suggesting a need for targeted retention programs for employees with Bachelor's degrees.


6. Age Group Analysis
25–34 years: The highest attrition (47.26%), indicating that younger employees are leaving at a faster rate.

35–44 years: 21.52% attrition rate.

45–54 years: 10.55%.

Under 25 and Over 55: Lowest attrition rates.

Key Insight: Younger employees, especially in the 25–34 age group, may be facing challenges in career development or work-life balance, driving them to seek opportunities elsewhere.


7. Job Role and Attrition
Laboratory Technicians and Sales Executives show the highest attrition rates (62 and 63 employees, respectively), followed by Research Scientists and Sales Representatives.

Key Insight: Sales-related roles appear to be particularly vulnerable to turnover, which suggests a deeper issue within this job function, potentially related to job stress, incentives, or workload.


8. Years Since Last Promotion
Attrition is highest within the first 0–5 years of the last promotion, suggesting dissatisfaction with career progression or lack of promotional opportunities.

Key Insight: Employees who haven’t been promoted in a while are more likely to leave, signaling a need for better career development programs.


9. Total Working Years
The dashboard shows a trend where attrition decreases as employees gain more experience. However, a spike is visible around the 10–20 years mark.

Key Insight: Mid-career professionals (with around 10–20 years of experience) seem to leave more frequently, potentially due to a plateau in career growth.


10. Salary Hike and Attrition
Employees receiving smaller salary hikes show higher attrition rates, especially those receiving between 10–15% increases.

Key Insight: There is a clear correlation between lower salary hikes and attrition, suggesting that employees might be dissatisfied with their compensation.
